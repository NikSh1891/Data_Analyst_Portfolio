# Nikita Shishkin - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About me
My name is Nikita and I love finding solutions to problems in data.
I am driven by the excitement of discovering new ideas and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
I enjoy exploring different types of data, preprocessing data, finding insights, visualizing data, running statistical tests on data, making predictions, looking for patterns, identifying trends.
In my free time, I enjoy learning new data analysis tools and techniques, and I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
I have experience in sales analytics in e-commerce, government and commercial procurement analytics in the field of computers and electronic equipment.

## Competencies
Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Wrangling, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, А/В test, Cohort analysis, Customer segmentation.
